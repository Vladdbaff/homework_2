                In information systems, a tag is a keyword or term assigned to a piece of information such as an
                internet bookmark, digital
                image, database record, or computer file}. This kind of metadata helps describe an item and allows
                it to be found again by
                browsing or searching.<a href="#1">[1]</a> Tags are generally chosen informally and personally by the
                items's creator or
                by its viewer,
                depending on the system, although they may also be chosen from a controlled vocabulary.<a
                    href="#2">[2]</a>
            </dd>
            <dt>

            <dd>
                HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML
                attributes are a
                modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element
                type or provides
                functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntex, an
                attribute is added to an
                HTML start tag.

                An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document or web
                page.[vague]
                HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. Each node can have HTML attributes
                specified. Nodes can
                also have content, including other nodes and text. Many HTML nodes represent semantics, or meaning. For
                example, the
                title node represents the title of the document.
